# Cave Explorer

You are a third-party ROV pilot who has been hired by the Amgine Corp. to explore and chart a cave that was found on one of their properties. 
Deemed unsafe for human exploration by a TCMA inspection, your job is to find POIs and items of value to help determine the value point of the cave and any assets held within it.
Explore the depths, map your surroundings, and track items of value for Amgine Corp. to receive bonus compensation! 
But be careful where you go looking...
